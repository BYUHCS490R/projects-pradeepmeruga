        <h3> Answering the following questions</h3>
        <ol type="I">
            <li>PEG is good for real-life photos with many colors and details, like pictures of people, places, or nature.</li>
            <li>GIF is good for simple images with few colors, like logos, icons, drawings, and small animations.</li>
            <li>PNG supports transparent backgrounds and keeps the image quality clear without losing details.</li>
            <li>Open the photo in photo editing software, change it to the size you need, and save it before using it. You can use a website like Pixlr to resize the image. In Windows, there is a built-in option to resize images. On a Mac, you can use the Preview app. These options help you resize the image easily.</li>
            <li>Because it makes the file smaller. Smaller files load faster on a website. CSS only changes the display size, not the file size.</li>
            <li>CSS validation is checking your CSS code to make sure there are no mistakes and it follows the correct rules.</li>
