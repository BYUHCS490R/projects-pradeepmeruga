        <h1>Monkey D Luffy</h1>
        <p>
           Monkey D. Luffy is the main character of the story One Piece. He is the leader of a group called the Straw Hat Pirates. Luffy is a very happy and brave person who wants to find a famous treasure to become the King of the Pirates. When he was a child, he ate a "Devil Fruit" that made his whole body turn into rubber, which means he can stretch his arms and legs very far to fight bad guys. Along with his crew, he travels across a dangerous ocean to reach his goal and help his friends along the way.</p>
        <p>
            Luffy is famous for the straw hat he always wears, which was a special gift from a great pirate named Shanks. He always shouts his favorite phrase: "I'm going to be the King of the Pirates!" He is a very kind person who hates bullies and will do anything to protect his friends. Even when things get really scary or difficult, he never gives up. Because he is so loyal and loves adventure, millions of people around the world enjoy watching his journey.
