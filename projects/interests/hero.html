           Monkey D. Luffy is the main character of the story One Piece. He is the leader of a group called the Straw Hat Pirates. Luffy is a very happy and brave person who wants to find a famous treasure to become the King of the Pirates. When he was a child, he ate a "Devil Fruit" that made his whole body turn into rubber, which means he can stretch his arms and legs very far to fight bad guys. Along with his crew, he travels across a dangerous ocean to reach his goal and help his friends along the way.</span></p>
