        <li>An abosulte link is a web page full address that will take us to different website when we click on it </li>
        <li>Root is the main folder od an website where everything is stored.  folder and file names are the location of files, together they make a path that tells the browser how to find the file </li>
        <li>a default document is that page tha open automatically when we visit the website</li>
        <li>absolute link is the full web address, a raltaive link points on the same webpage, relative links are used because they are shorte and easier to manage</li>
        <li>i have linked to first html from activities folder</li>
        <li>the tree rules for relative links are, use the file name it its in the same folder, add the folder name if its in the another folderf and use ../ to to back to previous folder</li>
        <li>I have link my last project structure.html </li>
        <li>no links do not need to be inside a nav tag. it is only for main menu links.</li>
