            <li>Inline CSS is added directly to an HTML tag and affects only that one part. Embedded CSS is written in the style section of a page and changes the look of that single page. External CSS is kept in a separate file and can control the design of many pages. </li>
            <li>External CSS helps to develop a website easily and makes it simple to change the design when needed. Instead of changing the code on every page, we can make changes in one single CSS file and it will apply to all pages.</li>
            <li>A selector is used to choose which part of the webpage CSS should style.</li>
